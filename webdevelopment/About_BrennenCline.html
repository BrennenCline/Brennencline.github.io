    <h1>Brennen Cline </h1>
        <h3>Heading 3 </h3>
            <p>I'm Brennen Cline, Iâ€™m a film production student at the University of Missouri, and throughout my life I have been striving to make the best videos possible to become a better storyteller. I created a YouTube channel in 2016 and made Lego stop-motion animations until moving over to a scripted video essay series that centered around gaming and had an overarching story. My passion for cinematography and photography is greatly rooted in my values. <br>
                In high school I was on my school news crew and experienced my first hands on directing experience while creating news segments and movie and TV parodies like "The Classroom" which was a spin on The Office. Also, while in high school I went to the business school NCAPS at got an internship with my school district to take photos and make flyers for social media and email newsletters.
               Then when I went to community college, some friends and I started our own news crew which improved student engagement and was even broadcasted to classrooms caroused campus. <br/> <br>
               My first job was as a cook at Godfather's Pizza, where I then became a casher/ waiter and then Manager. As manager I had to know the workings of not only the kitchen, but the dining room as well. Where I would assign tasks to make sure everything was getting done right and at an efficient time. While working here I learned a great deal about customer services and marketing. Now I work as a cook at 44 Tavern which has made me quicker on my feet and I learn skills faster.
            Now at the University of Missouri I am well involved in not only studding the art of movie making but get hands on experience making short films and projects.<br/>
