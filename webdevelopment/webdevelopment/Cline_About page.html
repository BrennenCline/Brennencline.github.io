<body> <p>I'm Brennen Cline, Iâ€™m a film production student at the University of Missouri, and throughout my life I have been striving to make the best videos possible to become a better storyteller. I created a YouTube channel in 2016 and made Lego stop-motion animations until moving over to a scripted video essay series that centered around gaming and had an overarching story. My passion for cinematography and photography is greatly rooted in my values. 
    In high school I was on my school news crew and experienced my first hands on directing experience while creating news segments and movie and TV parodies like "The Classroom" which was a spin on The Office. Also, while in high school I went to the business school NCAPS at got an internship with my school district to take photos and make flyers for social media and email newsletters, as well as work with local KC businesses to create podcast, stickers, and social media promotion.
   Then when I went to community college, some friends and I started our own news crew which improved student engagement and was even broadcasted to classrooms caroused campus. 
Now at the University of Missouri I am well involved in not only studding the art of movie making but get hands on experience making short films and projects.
