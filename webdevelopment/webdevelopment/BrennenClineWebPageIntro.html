    Hey my name is Brenne Cline!
Iâ€™m a Junor and Film Major with plans to become a movie writer/ director, With basically no experience with web design or coding other than my high school web design class which used Wix. My expectations for this class is to be able to make a basic website on my own that I can use for a portfolio of my work and to gain knowledge to make any websites I may want to make in the future. I really enjoy designing things. I have close to zero experience coding outside of ICT class in 7th grade. I have many favorite hobbies, but I really like photography, hiking, and just tinkering with video games and electronics older than me.
